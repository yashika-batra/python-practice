BINARY SEARCH: SUBMAJORITY VOTE

You are given a list of integers nums where each number represents a vote to a candidate.
Return the ids of the candidates that have greater than floor(n/3) votes, in ascending order.

Bonus: solve in O(1) space.

Constraints
n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums.

Example 1
Input: nums = [2, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]
Output: [5, 6]
Explanation: Both 5 and 6 have 40% of the votes.

Example 2
Input: nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3]
Output: [1]
