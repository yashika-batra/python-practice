BINARY SEARCH: KTH LAST NODE OF A LINKED LIST

Given a singly linked list node, return the value of the kth last node 
(0-indexed). k is guaranteed not to be larger than the size of the linked list.

This should be done in O(1) space.

Constraints
n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of node

Example 1
Input: node = [1, 2], k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The second last node has the val of 1

Example 2
Input: node = [0, 1, 2, 3], k = 2
Output: 1
