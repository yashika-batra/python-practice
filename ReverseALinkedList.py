BINARY SEARCH: REVERSE A LINKED LIST

Given a singly linked list node, return its reverse.
Bonus: Can you do this in O(1) space?

Constraints
n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the number of nodes in node

Example 1
Input: node = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: [4, 3, 2, 1]

Example 2
Input: node = [0, 1]
Output: [1, 0]
