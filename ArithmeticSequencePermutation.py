BINARY SEARCH: ARITHMETIC SEQUENCE PERMUTATION

Given a list of integers nums, return whether you can rearrange 
the order of nums such that the difference between every 
consecutive two numbers is the same.

Constraints
n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums

Example 1
Input: nums = [7, 1, 5, 3]
Output: True
Explanation: If we rearrange nums to [1, 3, 5, 7], then the difference between 
every two consecutive numbers is 2.

Example 2
Input: nums = [1, 5, 1, 5, 1, 5]
Output: False
Explanation: The difference between every consecutive two numbers alternates 
between 4 and -4.
