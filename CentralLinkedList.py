"""
BINARY SEARCH: CENTRAL LINKED LIST

Given a singly linked list node, return the value of the middle node. 
If there's two middle nodes, then return the second one.

Bonus: Solve using O(1) space.

Constraints
n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the number of nodes in node

Example 1
Input: node = [0, 1, 2]
Output: 1
