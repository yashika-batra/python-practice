BINARY SEARCH: 3-6-9

Given an integer n, return a list with each number from 1 to n, 
except if it's a multiple of 3 or has a 3, 6, or 9 in the number, 
it should be the string "clap".

Note: return the number as a string.

Constraints
n â‰¤ 100,000

Example 1
Input: n = 16
Output: ["1", "2", "clap", "4", "5", "clap", "7", "8", "clap", "10", "11", "clap", "clap", 
"14", "clap", "clap"]
Explanation: 
3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 are replaced by "clap" since they are divisible by 3.
13 is replaced since it has a 3 in the number.
16 is replaced since it has a 6 in the number.
