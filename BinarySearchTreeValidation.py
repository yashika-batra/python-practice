BINARY SEARCH: BINARY SEARCH TREE VALIDATION

Given a binary tree root, return whether it's a binary search tree. 
A binary tree node is a binary search tree if :
All nodes on its left subtree are smaller than node.val
All nodes on its right subtree are bigger than node.val
All nodes hold the these properties.

Constraint
n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the number of nodes in root

Example 1
Input: root = [3, [2, null, null], [9, [7, [4, null, null], 
[8, null, null]], [12, null, null]]]
Output: True
Example 2
Input: root = [3, [1, null, null], [5, [4, null, [7, null, null]], 
[6, null, null]]]
Output: False
Explanation: This is not a binary search tree because the 7 is 
not smaller than 5.
