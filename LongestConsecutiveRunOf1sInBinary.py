BINARY SEARCH: LONGEST CONSECUTIVE RUN OF 1S IN BINARY

Given a non-negative integer n, return the length of the longest 
consecutive run of 1s in its binary representation.

Constraints
0 â‰¤ n < 2 ** 31

Example 1
Input: n = 156
Output: 3
Explanation: 156 is10011100 in binary and there's a run of length 3.
