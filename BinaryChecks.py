BINARY SEARCH: BINARY CHECKS

Given a list of integers prices representing prices of cars for 
sale, and a budget k, return the maximum number of cars you can buy.

Constraints
n â‰¤ 200,000 where n is the length of prices

Example 1
Input: prices = [90, 30, 20, 40, 90], k = 95
Output: 3
Explanation: We can buy the cars with prices 30, 20, and 40.

Example 2
Input: prices = [60, 90, 55, 75], k = 50
Output: 0
Explanation: We cannot afford any of these cars.
